# Figure out any problem which you can't solve on a classical computer

## üß© 1. The Halting Problem (Undecidable)
This is the classic example, discovered by Alan Turing in 1936.
üí° Problem: Can a computer program determine whether another program will eventually stop (halt) or run forever?
Answer: No, it‚Äôs impossible to create a program that correctly solves this for all other programs.
‚úÖ Works for some cases.
‚ùå But a universal solution doesn't exist.

## üö´ 2. The Entscheidungsproblem (Decision Problem)
This was part of David Hilbert‚Äôs goal to formalize all mathematics. Turing and G√∂del proved it‚Äôs impossible.
üí° Problem: Can a machine decide whether any given mathematical statement is provable?
Answer: No. Some truths can't be proven using any formal system.

## ‚õî 3. G√∂del‚Äôs Incompleteness Theorems
These don‚Äôt describe computing problems per se, but they limit what any logic-based system (including software) can prove or solve.
üí° Main idea: In any powerful enough system, there will always be true statements that cannot be proven within that system.

## üìâ 4. Problems Too Complex (Intractable)
Even if a problem is theoretically solvable, it might be computationally infeasible (i.e., would take more time than the age of the universe).
    ‚Ä¢ Example: Traveling Salesman Problem for 10,000 cities (NP-Hard)
    ‚Ä¢ No known efficient algorithms exist for some of these problems
    ‚Ä¢ Quantum computing might help with some, but not all


# Find out what sort of physical technologies are currently being worked on to build and generate cubits

## Superconducting Qubits
    ‚Ä¢ How It Works: Uses superconducting circuits cooled near absolute zero to create quantized energy states.
    ‚Ä¢ Pros: Mature technology, good scalability, supported by major companies.
    ‚Ä¢ Cons: Requires extreme cooling, still prone to errors.
    ‚Ä¢ Current Leaders: IBM, Google, Rigetti.
## Trapped Ion Qubits
    ‚Ä¢ How It Works: Uses ions trapped in electromagnetic fields; qubits stored in ions‚Äô internal states, manipulated by lasers.
    ‚Ä¢ Pros: Very stable qubits, long coherence times.
    ‚Ä¢ Cons: Slow gate speeds, scaling is harder.
    ‚Ä¢ Current Leaders: IonQ, Quantinuum.
## Spin Qubits (Quantum Dots)
    ‚Ä¢ How It Works: Uses the spin of electrons in semiconductor nanostructures.
    ‚Ä¢ Pros: Smaller and potentially integrable with existing chip technology.
    ‚Ä¢ Cons: Fabrication and control challenges.
    ‚Ä¢ Current Leaders: Intel, Delft University.
## Photonic Qubits
    ‚Ä¢ How It Works: Encodes qubits in photons‚Äô polarization or path.
    ‚Ä¢ Pros: Works at room temperature, easy to transmit over distance.
    ‚Ä¢ Cons: Photon losses, requires efficient single-photon sources.
    ‚Ä¢ Current Leaders: Xanadu, PsiQuantum.
## Topological Qubits
    ‚Ä¢ How It Works: Uses exotic quasiparticles (anyons) that store information in their braiding (topology).
    ‚Ä¢ Pros: Theoretically very resistant to errors.
    ‚Ä¢ Cons: Still experimental ‚Äî no large-scale systems yet.
    ‚Ä¢ Current Leaders: Microsoft (StationQ).
