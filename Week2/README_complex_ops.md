# Complex Number Operations & Visualization

This original Python program:
- Takes two complex numbers
- Computes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Plots each result on a complex plane in separate figures

## Usage
1. Install matplotlib:
   pip install matplotlib
2. Run with preset values:
   python complex_ops_visualizer.py --demo
3. Or enter numbers interactively:
   python complex_ops_visualizer.py

## Division by Zero
Division by zero is undefined because no unique number satisfies a = 0 Ã— c.
