## Research Task on Division by Zero: Need to figure out why division by zero is not possible and be prepared to share some videos about it in the next class.

# Why division by zero isn’t possible.
Division answers “how many times does b go into a?”. Formally, a / b = c means a = b × c.
    • If b ≠ 0, there’s a unique c that satisfies the equation.
    • If b = 0, then b × c = 0 for every value of c—there’s no unique answer. So the operation is undefined.
From a limits viewpoint, as the divisor shrinks toward 0, the quotient grows without bound (tends to ±∞), which isn’t a real number; you can’t assign a consistent value at exactly 0 without breaking arithmetic.
Programming languages reflect this: dividing by zero raises an error (e.g., ZeroDivisionError in Python) because the math itself has no well-defined result.

## Research Task on Electrical Frequencies: You are tasked with finding out the different frequencies (in Hertz) on which electrical appliances work in different countries and the reasons behind these differences.

Electrical Frequencies Around the World
    1. Main Standards
        ○ 50 Hz AC – Common in Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, NZ.
        ○ 60 Hz AC – Common in USA, Canada, Philippines, parts of South America, some Asian countries.
    2. Country Examples
        ○ 50 Hz (220–240 V): UK, NZ, Australia, India, South Africa.
        ○ 60 Hz (110–120 V): USA, Canada, Mexico.
        ○ 60 Hz (220–240 V): Philippines, Saudi Arabia.
        ○ Mixed: Japan – East (50 Hz), West (60 Hz).
    3. Reasons for Differences
        ○ Historical choices by early power companies (Germany → 50 Hz, USA → 60 Hz).
        ○ Infrastructure lock-in – too costly to change once systems were built.
        ○ Colonial/trade influence – countries adopted their colonizer’s or main partner’s standard.
    4. Effects
        ○ Appliances may run at wrong speed/frequency in other regions.
        Modern electronics often work on both (50/60 Hz), but motors and some clocks may not.
